## Description

This is a simple Memory Game. The goal is to match the pair of cards with as few moves as possible in the least time possible for the highest rating.


## Goal of the game

Match all the cards and get a 3 star rating.

## Instructions

* Download the .zip file and open index.html to play.
* Click on a card to reveal it
* Keep on revealing cards in pairs that match

## How the game was created

The game was created in HTML to create the wireframe, then styled with CSS and at last, the DOM was manipulated with Javascript to make it interactive.

I also did the following:

* a deck of cards that is shuffeled every time the game is refreshed or you want to play again
* a move counter to count the moves that the player made (the moves are counted for each pair of cards)
Example: If you reveal two cards, one move will be counted
* added animations to the cards when they are revealed, they match or they don't match
* created a congratulations pop-up that shows up when the game ends with all the stats and functionality to play again
