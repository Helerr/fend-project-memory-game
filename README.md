## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Description

This is a simple Memory Game. The goal is to match the pair of cards with as few moves as possible in the least time possible for the highest rating.
The game was created in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and it's browser based.
